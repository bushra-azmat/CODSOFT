                            Calculator
        Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
        Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
                Perform the calculation and display the result.

# Obtain the first number from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Obtain the Operator from the User
operator = input("Enter the arithmetic operator from following list (+, -, *, /, ^): ")
print(int(num1), operator)

num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
print(int(num1), operator, int(num2))
# Perform the requested arithmetic operation
if operator == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operator == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
